# Generalised Data Structure Library
This is a C++ library that provides a collection of general-purpose data structures. The library includes implementations of the following data structures:

Singly Linked List (SinglyLL)
Singly Circular Linked List (SinglyCL)
Doubly Linked List (DoublyLL)
Doubly Circular Linked List (DoublyCL)
Stack
Queue
Binary Search Tree (BST)
Each data structure is templated to allow storing elements of any data type. The library is designed to be flexible and versatile, enabling efficient manipulation and management of data in various scenarios.

# Usage
Include the appropriate header file for the desired data structure in your C++ code.
Create an instance of the data structure using the provided class.
Utilize the available member functions to perform operations on the data structure, such as inserting elements, deleting elements, searching, counting, and displaying the data.
Please refer to the individual header files for detailed descriptions of the available member functions and their usage.

# Note
This library aims to provide a foundation for working with common data structures in C++.
